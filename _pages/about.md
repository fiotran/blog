<p>Fiona has extensive front-end development experience that includes HTML and Javascript, and over the last three years has focused on Angular and Typescript. During the day, she builds Angular applications for the web and in her spare time she is passionate about sharing her knowledge with anyone who wants to learn.

She is now going full-stack and exploring the back-end world of C#, .Net and Azure.

Aside from tech, she loves all things tennis and has travelled the world to watch (almost) all of the big tournaments. Her next challenge is to complete a half marathon.
